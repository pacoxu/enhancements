## Summary

This document presents a design to allow Kubernetes to pass metadata such as Pod name and namespace to the CSI `NodePublishVolume` call if a CSI driver requires it.

The detailed design was originally implemented as a [design proposal](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/storage/container-storage-interface-pod-information.md).

This KEP contains details that are missing from the design proposal.

## Test Plan

* Unit tests in kubelet volume manager.
* E2E tests:
    * `CSI workload information [Feature:CSIDriverRegistry]` via CSI mock driver 

## Graduation Criteria

### Alpha to Beta

* Basic unit and e2e tests as outlined in the test plan.

### Beta to GA

* At least one CSI driver implemented using this feature in production.

## Implementation History

* K8s 1.12: Alpha implementation
* K8s 1.14: Beta implementation
* K8s 1.18: GA implementation
